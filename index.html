        <h3>Class Officer Selection</h2>
          <br>
        <p>At the very first part of the 1st quarter of our grade, we did our best to get footing<br> 
          in our new section. We met up with old friends, and also met new people.<br>
          <br>
           We also had the election of officers in our first quarter.
          <br>
        </p>
        <p>
           The officers in this picture from left to right are:
        </p>
          <br>
          <ul>
           <li><b>Paulo</b> - Male Seargent at Arms</li>
           <li><b>James</b> - PRO</li>
           <li><b>Julian</b> - Auditor</li>
           <li><b>Gabriel</b> (Gab) - Treasurer</li>
           <li><b>Audre</b> - Secretary</li>
           <li><b>Lexi</b> - Vice President</li>
           <li><b>Dominique</b> - President</li>

        <h3>Prehistoric Artwork</h3>
          <br>
        <p>
           Somewhere around the middle of the first quarter,<br>
           we were tasked with making an art work which imitates the art done during the prehistoric ages.<br>
          <br>
           This is probably one of the things i did that made me start drawing again,<br>
           although the art i made myself is not good.<br>
          <br>
           This is an example of the artwork (not mine, Lendrick's)...

          <h3>English Movie Trailer</h2>
          <br>
          <p>
            Another thing we did in the 1st Quarter that i think is memorable would be the english trailer task.<br>
            Our group were tasked to make a trailer on a movie,<br>
            and the story we picked revolves around a teacher.<br>
            <br>
            I was the chosen to be the teacher, and I must admit my acting was pretty embarassing. <br>
            But hey, it works.

        <h3>MAPEH Video Task</h3>
        <br>
        <p>
          Another Memorable Performance Task is the one from MAPEH<br>
          about promoting nature's protection.<br>
          Our group was task to make a video edit promoting the protection<br> 
          and cleanliness of our environment.<br>
          <br>
          Very Fun.

        <h3>Introduction of the AP Interactive</h2>
        <br>
        <p>
          The last important part of this quarter would be the introduction of the<br>
          Interactive AP Notebook.<br>
          <br>
          This task caused alot of pain and hardship througout the entire school year.<br>
          <br>
          I still dont know why this is a thing.

            <br>
          <p>The second quarter was the quarter where there were a lot of events.<br>
             One of the first events was the Mr & Ms Booklandia, which was a costume contest<br>
             held in tribute for the english week.<br>
             <br>
             Our section's representative was Lendrick,<br>
             and he looked like Cpt. Price from Call of Duty.<br>
             <br>
             I wasn't able to find a picture of the contest,<br>
             But here is what he looked like.<br>

          <h3>ESP Film Festival</h3>
            <br>
          <p>
            For the Film Festival, we were tasked in ESP to make a trailer<br>
            on a movie with the a story related to social issues.<br>
            <br>
            Whoever had the best trailer in class would fight other sections,<br>
            our group didn't win but our, trailer was still pretty banger,<br>
            in my opinion.<br>
            <br>
            Here is our group's trailer, on the left.

            <p>
              We were tasked in MAPEH to dance the Cha-cha.<br>
              <br>
              Im not good at dancing,<br> 
              but a performance task is a performance task.

            <br>
          <p>
            One of the most prominent events last year was the V-Pop<br>
            Everybody put alot of effort and practice for this.<br>
            <br>
            We encountered alot of arguments,<br>
            and we also didnt get any award,<br>
            But i'm still glad it all went well.<br>
            <br>

            Last but not the least in the 2nd Quarter is the Christmas Party.<br>
            <br>
            The whole thing was wild,<br>
            But we all got to know each other more and have some fun.<br>
            <br>
            I also got myself a water gun.

            One of the first big things that happened in the 3rd quarter is the Waltz Performance.<br>
            almost the same premise of performance as the Cha-cha,<br>
            but with a larger group.<br>
            <br>
            Pretty darn fun.

            We had a task in ESP where we were supposed to take an impromptu picture<br>
            of a person or people helping the society.<br>
            <br>
            It was hard to find a good photo subject,<br>
            so i went to a place where people always help society.

            <h3>Variety Show</h2>
            <br><br><br><br>
            <p>
              One of the most important and fun events in grade 9,<br>
              in my personal opinion, would be the Variety Show.<br>
              <br>
              Everybody had to tirelessly practice and work together to put together 
              the variety show, and the output was in simple terms,<br>
               a banger.<br>
              <br>
              Very much fun and also less classes due to practice at that time. Wohoo!<br>
              <br>
              I also learned that i can play the drums.

            Pretty tight performance task if i'd say so myself. 
            We were tasked to make a research planand proposal,<br> 
            and then present it to 3 judges.<br>
            <br>
            When we presented, we got roasted by the judges<br>
            (Manzo specifically).<br>
            <br>
            Learned alot about how to talk formally.
